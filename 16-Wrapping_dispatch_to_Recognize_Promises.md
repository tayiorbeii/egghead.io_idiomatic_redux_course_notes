# 16. Wrapping `dispatch()` to Recognize Promises
[Video Link](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-wrapping-dispatch-to-recognize-promises)

The `receiveTodos` action creator is not very useful by itself because anytime we call it, we want to fetch the `todos` first. Since `fetchTodos` and `receiveTodos` accept the same arguments, it would be great if we could group this code into a single action creator.

#### Existing `fetchData()` inside `VisibleTodoList`
```javascript
fetchData() {
  const { filter, receiveTodos } = this.props;
  fetchTodos(filter).then(todos =>
    receiveTodos(filter, todos)
  );
}
```

### Refactoring our Action creators

We'll get started by importing our fake API into our action creators file (`src/actions/index.js`).

`import * as api from '../api'`

Now we'll add an asynchronous action creator called `fetchTodos`. It takes `filter` as an argument, and then it calls the API's `fetchTodos` method with it.

I'm using the Promise `then` method to transform the result of the Promise from the `response` to the action object generated by `receiveTodos` given the `filter` and the `response`.

#### Inside `src/actions/index.js`
```javascript
export const fetchTodos = (filter) =>
  api.fetchTodos(filter).then(response =>
    receiveTodos(filter, response)
  );
```

`receiveTodos` returns an action object synchronously, but `fetchTodos` returns a Promise that resolves through the action object.

Now can stop exporting `receiveTodos` from our action creators because we can change the components to use `fetchTodos` directly.

### Updating `VisibleTodoList`

Back in our component file, we can use the `fetchTodos` prop injected by `connect`. This corresponds to the new asynchronous `fetchTodos` action creator we just wrote.

We can remove `import { fetchTodos } from '../api'` because from now on we will be using the `fetchTodos` action creator, which is injected into the props by `connect`.

```javascript
fetchData() {
  const { filter, fetchTodos } = this.props;
  fetchTodos(filter);
}
```

### Recapping what we just did...

The `fetchTodos` action creator calls the `fetchTodos` function from the API, but then it transforms its result into a Redux action generated by `receiveTodos`.

However, by default, Redux only allows dispatching plain objects rather than Promises. We can teach it to recognize Promises by using the same trick that we used in `addLoggingToDispatch()` inside of `configureStore.js` (recall that the `addLoggingToDispatch` function takes the `dispatch` from the `store` and returns a new version of `dispatch` that logs every action and the `state`).

### Adding Promise Support

Inside of `configureStore.js`, we will create a function `addPromiseSupport()` that takes the `store` and returns a version of `dispatch` that supports promises.

First, we will grab the `rawDispatch` function at it is defined on the `store` so that we can call it later. We return a function that has the same API as a dispatch function-- that is, it takes an action.

```javascript
const addPromiseSupportToDispatch = (store) => {
  const rawDispatch = store.dispatch;
  return (action) => {
    if (typeof action.then === 'function') {
      return action.then(rawDispatch);
    }
    return rawDispatch(action);
  };
};
```

Since we don't know if the `action` is a real action or a promise of an action, we check if it has a `then` method that is a function. If it does, then we know it is a promise. If the action is a promise, we wait for it to resolve to an action object that we will pass through `rawDispatch`.

Otherwise, we'll just call `rawDispatch` right away with the `action` object we received.

Our new `addPromiseSupportToDispatch` function allows us to dispatch both actions and promises that resolve to actions.

To finish up, we need to call our new function one more time before returning the store to the app.

```javascript
// At the bottom of `configureStore.js`
const configureStore = () => {
  const store = createStore(todoApp);

  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
    store.dispatch = addLoggingToDispatch(store);
  }

  store.dispatch = addPromiseSupportToDispatch(store);

  return store;
};
```

If we run the app now, we will still see the `'RECEIVE_TODOS'` action being dispatched when the response is ready. However, the component uses a more convenient API that encapsulates the asynchronous logic in the asynchronous action creator.

### Order Matters

Remember that the order in which we override the `dispatch` function inside of `configureStore` is important.

If we change it so that we call `addPromiseSupportToDispatch` before `addLoggingToDispatch`, the action will first be printed and then the promise will be processed

This would give us an action type of `undefined` and we see the Promise instead of the action, which is not very useful.
