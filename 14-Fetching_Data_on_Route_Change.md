#14. Fetching Data on Route Change
[Video Link](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-fetching-data-on-route-change)

To start, we'll remove the `fetchTodos` test API call from our `index.js` entry point because we want to fetch the todos from inside our `VisibleTodoList` component.

We'll start by importing `fetchTodos` into `VisibleTodoList.js`

`import { fetchTodos } from '../api';`


The `VisibleTodoList` component is generated by the `connect` and `withRouter` calls that each generate an intermediate component that injects props.

A good place to call our `fetchTodos` API would be inside the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle hook. However, we can't override the life cycle hooks of generated components! This means we have to create a new React component.

### Creating a New React Component

Inside of `VisibleTodoList.js`, we'll import `React` and the `Component` base class from React. We will then declare a React component class called `VisibleTodoList` that extends the base component class.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
// other imports...

class VisibleTodoList extends Component {
  render() {
    return <TodoList {...this.props} />;
  }
}
.
.
.
```

We still want to render the presentational `TodoList` component exactly as before. The only purpose of adding this new class is to add the lifecycle hooks. Any props will be passed down to the `TodoList`.

Now that `VisibleTodoList` is defined as a class above, we can't declare another constant with the same name, so we reassign the `VisibleTodoList` binding to point to the wrapped component. We'll also change the `connect()` call to wrap our new class instead.

```javascript
VisibleTodoList = withRouter(connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  { onTodoClick: toggleTodo }
)(VisibleTodoList));

export default VisibleTodoList;
```

The component generated by the `connect()` call will render the `VisibleTodoList` class we defined. The result of the `connect` and `withRouter` wrapping calls is the final `VisibleTodoList` component that we export from the file.

### Adding Lifecycle Hooks

When the component mounts, we want to fetch the todos for the current filter.

It will be convenient to have the filter directly available as a prop, so we change `mapStateToProps` to calculate the `filter` from `params` like it used to do, but we will also pass it as one of the properties of the `return` object. So now we'll get both the `todos` and the `filter` itself inside of the `VisibleTodoList` component.

#### Updating `mapStateToProps`
```javascript
const mapStateToProps = (state, { params }) => {
  const filter = params.filter || 'all';
  return {
    todos: getVisibleTodos(state, filter),
    filter,
  };
};
```

Going back to the lifecycle method, we can use `this.props.filter` inside `componentDidMount`. When the todos are fetched, `fetchTodos` returns a Promise. We can use the `then` method to access the resolved `todos`, and log the current `filter` and the `todos` we just received from the fake backend.

#### Implementing `componentDidMount`
```javascript
class VisibleTodoList extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    fetchTodos(this.props.filter).then(todos =>
      console.log(this.props.filter, todos)
    );
  }
```


With our current implementation, running the app will show the `all` filter being printed, and the corresponding `todos`.

However, nothing will happen when filters are changed, because `componentDidMount` only runs once. To fix this, we need to add a second lifecycle hook called `componentDidUpdate`.

#### Implementing `componentDidUpdate`
```javascript
// inside the `VisibleTodoList` below `componentDidMount()`
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
   if (this.props.filter !== prevProps.filter) {
     fetchTodos(this.props.filter).then(todos =>
       console.log(this.props.filter, todos)
     );
   }
 }
```

`componentDidUpdate` receives the previous props as an argument. We then compare the current and the previous values of the filter. If the current filter is not the same as the previous filter, we call `fetchTodos()` for the current filter.
