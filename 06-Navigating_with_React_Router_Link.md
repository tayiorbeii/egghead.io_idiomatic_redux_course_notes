# 06. Navigating with React Router `<Link>`
[Video Link](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-navigating-with-react-router-link?series=building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux)

In this lesson we will update the "links" that control the visibility filter to behave more like _real_ links. We're going to change it so our browser's "Back" button works, and the URL changes when we switch filters.

We'll start by adding a parameter to the Route `path` called `filter`. We wrap it in parens to tell React Router that it's optional (we want all Todos shown by default).

#### Update `Root.js`
```javascript
const Root = ({ store }) => (
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Router history={browserHistory}>
      <Route path="/(:filter)" component={App} />
    </Router>
  </Provider>
);
.
.
.
```

### Update Links in `Footer.js`
We also need to update our visibility filter links inside of the footer.

#### `Footer.js` Before
```javascript
...
const Footer = () => (
  <p>
    Show:
    {" "}
    <FilterLink filter="SHOW_ALL">
      All
    </FilterLink>
    {", "}
    <FilterLink filter="SHOW_ACTIVE">
      Active
    </FilterLink>
    {", "}
    <FilterLink filter="SHOW_COMPLETED">
      Completed
    </FilterLink>
  </p>
);

export default Footer;
```

The previous implementation used the convention for the `filter` prop, but we will update them to align with the "active" and "completed" paths we want displayed in the address bar.

#### `Footer.js` After
```javascript
// Rest as above...
<p>
  Show:
  {" "}
  <FilterLink filter="all">
    All
  </FilterLink>
  {", "}
  <FilterLink filter="active">
    Active
  </FilterLink>
  {", "}
  <FilterLink filter="completed">
    Completed
  </FilterLink>
</p>
```

We use a null string to signify the default path and avoid passing an empty string.

### Update `FilterLink.js` Implementation
In our current implementation, the `FilterLink` component dispatches an action every time that it's clicked, then reads its active state from the store and compares its `filter` prop to the `visibilityFilter` in the store.

#### `FilterLink.js` Before
```javascript
...
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
  active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter,
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({
  onClick() {
    dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter));
  },
});

const FilterLink = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(Link);

export default FilterLink;
```

However, we no longer need this implementation since we want the router to be in control of any state that is in the URL. We'll import `Link` from `react-router` and use it in our new implementation.

`FilterLink` now accepts `filter` as a prop, and render it through React Router's `Link`.

The `to` prop corresponds to path we want the link to point to, so if the `filter` is `'all'`, we're going to use the root path, otherwise we will use `filter` itself as the URL's path.

We also will use the `activeStyle` prop to style it differently when its `to` prop matches the current path.

We pass `children` to the `Link` itself, and add `children` as a prop to `FilterLink` so that the parent component can specify the children.

#### `FilterLink.js` After
```javascript
import React, { PropTypes } from 'react';
import { Link } from 'react-router';

const FilterLink = ({ filter, children }) => (
  <Link
    to={filter === 'all' ? '' : filter}
    activeStyle={{
      textDecoration: 'none',
      color: 'black',
    }}
  >
    {children}
  </Link>
);

FilterLink.propTypes = {
  filter: PropTypes.oneOf(['all', 'completed', 'active']).isRequired,
  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,
};

export default FilterLink;
```

### More Cleanup to Do...
We are no longer using the `setVisibilityFilter` action creator, so it can be removed from `src/actions/index.js`, leaving us with just `addTodo` and `toggleTodo` action creators.

We can also delete our custom `Link` component from `src/components` since we are now using the one provided by `react-router`.
